MyController is an IoT automation controller for home, office or any place.<br>
There is no internet requirement for the MyController.
You can run the complete setup on your private environment<br>
MyController is designed to run with a limited resources.
It can run on the first generation of the Raspberry PI.<br>

MyController 2.x is completely redesigned.

## [Architecture Guide](/docs/overview/architecture/)

## MyController Services and Bundles
MyController has many services and all communicates via `Message Bus`.<br>
Based on the services and use cases, MyController bundled as follows,
  - [All-In-One bundle](#all-in-one-bundle-and-setup)
  - [Core bundle](#core-bundle-and-setup)
  - [Gateway bundle](#gateway-bundle-and-setup)

### All-In-One bundle and setup
![all-in-one setup](/doc-images/all-in-one-setup.png)
* **This is the most suitable package for most of the use cases**
* This package contains MyController Core services + Gateway service
* All the services combined and bundled as single binary
* With All-In-One package it is possible to use `Embedded` Bus, which cannot be accessible outside of the MyController server (**Options #1**)
* If you plan to use `external gateway` you have to go with [external bus service (natsio)](/docs/getting-started/install-natsio/) (**Option #2**)

### Core bundle and setup
![core setup](/doc-images/core-setup.png)
* This package contains MyController Core services only. Gateway service excluded
* It is mandatory to run external bus service for this setup to join a gateway

### Gateway bundle and setup
![gateway setup](/doc-images/gateway-setup.png)
* This package contains only gateway service component
* This service can be connected to a `Core Service` or `All-In-One service` via a external message bus.
* You can have a multiple gateway services on a different hosts
